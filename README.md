# Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Classification using Deep Learning
Mapping the extent of land use and land cover categories over time is essential for better environmental monitoring, urban planning and nature protection. Train and fine-tune a deep learning model to classify satellite images into 10 LULC categories.
